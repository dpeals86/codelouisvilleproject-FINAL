This website is collection of my amateur photography work. My portfolio can be viewed up close through a lightbox feature by clicking on a photo. 


-------Custom CSS Class------

Some of classes I created are:

.gallery 

.gallery img 
   
.gallery img:hover

.Logo

.backgroundimg


----Custom Javascript Functions-------


The Javascript function I created:

document.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Congratulations My Site Has Loaded!!!');
  alert('WELCOME TO DARK GOLD')
})

The function prints "Congratulations My Site Has Loaded!!!" to the Console log which you can view in dev tools console, then it prompts you with an alert box that say "welcome to dark gold"
