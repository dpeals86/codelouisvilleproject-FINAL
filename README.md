This website is collection of my amateur photography work. My portfolio can be viewed up close through a lightbox feature by clicking on a photo. 


-------Custom CSS Class------

Some of classes I created are:

.gallery 

.gallery img 
   
.gallery img:hover

.Logo

.backgroundimg


----Custom Javascript Functions-------


The Javascript function I created:

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  console.log('Congratulations My Site Has Loaded!!!');
  alert('WELCOME TO DARK GOLD');
})

//Function will reveal "Congratulations My Site Has Loaded" in console log, prompt with an alert box 'WELCOME TO DARK GOLD'//
